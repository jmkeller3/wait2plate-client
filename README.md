# Wait2Plate App

An application to search, find, and report the fastest food option near users. 

## Motivation
I recently moved across the country and had numberous new options for eating out. 
However, time is often an important factor in choosing a restaurant. This App offers users a 
means to search and report the wait times of restaurants near them.
